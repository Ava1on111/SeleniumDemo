# Selenium W10 Demo
My first Selenium Junit demo

* Read the official documentation for Selenium Webdriver:
* Download gecko webdriver for Firefox and your operating system here:
** or check out site for downloading the chrome webdriver here:

NOTE 1: If you use chrome, the POM file of the demo should also be updated with the chrome equivalent from the maven repository

NOTE 2: Using chrome requires a few more steps.

* Clone this repository or download and extract zip file of Selenium demo project to your own directory
* ensure the directory location to the gecko file is corrected in the Junit test case
* Run Junit testcases.
